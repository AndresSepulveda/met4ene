#Use these steps to create the optwrf conda environment
1. Navigate to ~/met4ene/config
2. Run `conda env create -f <computer>_optwrf_env.yml`
3. Navigate to ~/met4ene/optwrf
4. Run `pip install -e .` (Install in edit mode)
5. Navigate to ~/pvlib-python directory
6. Run `pip install -e .` (Install in edit mode)
7. Navigate to ~/conda/envs/optwrf/bin
8. Run 'rm mpi*' (if you fail to do this, WRF will not work properly as it was
   compiled with executables on the HPC system rather than the one's installed by conda.)
