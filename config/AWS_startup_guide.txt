New AWS Instance Setup Guide

1. Generate a publickey on AWS instance and add it to bitbucket. A guide is here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-an-ssh-key-728138079.html

2. Clone met4ene repository into /environment directory on AWS instance. 

3. Because software compilation is not a task that every Amazon EC2 instance requires, these tools are not installed by default, but they are available in a package group called "Development Tools" that is easily added to an instance with the yum groupinstall command:

sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"

4. To use some WRF functionality, install tcsh:

sudo yum install tcsh

5. Copy the bash_profile_temp_aws and tcshrc_temp_aws to .bash_profile and .tcshrc, respectively.

6. Increase the size of the AWS instance to 100GB via the Volumes tab on the EC2 dashboard. YOU MUST STOP AND REINITIALIZE THE INSTANCE AFTER YOU DO THIS.

7. Install and intialize the met4ene anaconda3 environment by running met4ene/config/condainstall.sh (this is not currently working... it may be due to the fact that it takes some minutes for the volume to expand.)

8. Install and compile WRF and WPS via met4ene/config/install_packages.sh

You should now be ready to run wrf!
