About
-----

met4ene is a Python package for running the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for the purpose of renewable energy integration.
Users can flexibly setup and run the WRF model using a specified set of physics schemes, or (if computational resources are not a barrier) this package allows them to optimize the choice of physics schemes using a genetic algorithm.
