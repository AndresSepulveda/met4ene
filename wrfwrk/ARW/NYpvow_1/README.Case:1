This directory is for running the Case 1 of the NY offshore wind pv study for one day in each season.
Case 1 contains an offshore wind farm where the turbines are split evenly among the four offshore 
wind sites and the spacing is 5D and 9D for spanwise and streamwise turbine separation, respectively.

The directories within NYpvow_cntl correspond to the dates for which the WRF model was run.
